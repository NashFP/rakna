1 Räkna 
~~~~~~~~~~~
Räkna, pronounced: "wreck nah" according to Google's English->Swedish translation, is intended to be a time-series based, (soon-to-be) distributed, incremental/decremental 
counting mechanism with support for integers and floats.

What's under the hood? Aside from the rushed API for spawnfest?
	eleveldb storage for persistent data for starters.
	Ulf Wiger's sext library for aiding leveldb with sequential writes (took this trick from the leveldb driver in Riak).
	webmachine for a rock-solid REST API.
